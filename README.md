W3b Stitch ðŸª¡

A trust engine for verified media, credentials, and decentralized identity.

Overview

W3b Stitch is a prototype trust layer for the internet. It combines media verification, credential provenance, decentralized identity, event-driven trust recalculation, and blockchain anchoring into a single framework.

The goal: empower platforms, communities, and organizations to verify content, credentials, and reputations at scaleâ€”while preserving privacy and interoperability with open standards.

This repository contains the MVP implementation of the six core W3b Stitch modules as defined in the original patent specification.

Core Modules

1. Media Verification & Curation (MVCM)
	â€¢	Verifies digital media integrity by generating cryptographic hashes.
	â€¢	Prevents tampering, duplicates, and misinformation spread.

2. Credential Authentication & Provenance (CAPM)
	â€¢	Issues and validates credentials with verifiable cryptographic proofs.
	â€¢	Supports selective disclosure for privacy-preserving verification.

3. Decentralized Identity & Reputation (DIRM)
	â€¢	Simple DID (Decentralized Identifier) registration.
	â€¢	Naive in-memory reputation scoring to demonstrate dynamic trust adjustment.

4. Security, Integrity & Confidentiality Layer (SICL)
	â€¢	Placeholder for advanced privacy-preserving cryptography.
	â€¢	Demo includes selective disclosure and proof-of-integrity hashing.

5. Event-Driven Orchestration & Trust Core (EOTC)
	â€¢	Recalculates trust dynamically as new events (e.g., user actions, endorsements) are processed.
	â€¢	Event logs update DID reputation in real-time.

6. State Packaging & Two-Tier Anchoring
	â€¢	Packages state into verifiable bundles.
	â€¢	Anchors to Layer 2 (fast chain) for scalability and Layer 1 (Ethereum/Polygon) for immutable audit trails.

Architecture
	â€¢	FastAPI backend for APIs.
	â€¢	Adapters to connect with external platforms (Twitter, TikTok, web scraping).
	â€¢	Web3 integration for blockchain anchoring.
	â€¢	.env configuration for API keys and RPC URLs.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
	â€¢	Python 3.10+
	â€¢	Git & GitHub
	â€¢	A blockchain RPC endpoint (e.g., World Chain, Sepolia)
	â€¢	Optional: Twitter API v2 keys for media/social adapters
 # clone repo
git clone https://github.com/rocketjays-cmyk/w3b-stitch.git
cd w3b-stitch

# create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload
Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for interactive API testing.
Example Workflows
	1.	Verify Media
	â€¢	Upload an image â†’ get its SHA256 hash â†’ cross-check against known records.
	2.	Issue a Credential
	â€¢	Provide issuer, subject, and claims â†’ system generates credential + cryptographic hash.
	3.	Anchor State
	â€¢	Bundle credential or event â†’ push to L2 blockchain (fast settlement) and checkpoint to L1 for auditability.
	4.	Query Social Media (via adapters)
	â€¢	Pull tweets or posts â†’ hash and verify content authenticity.

Roadmap
	â€¢	Persist reputation & credential data in Postgres/Mongo.
	â€¢	Upgrade DID system to integrate wallet-based identity.
	â€¢	Add zk-proofs for privacy-preserving disclosure.
	â€¢	Build Next.js dashboard for end-user interaction.
	â€¢	Package grant-ready SDKs for partners.
Vision

W3b Stitch aims to become the universal trust engine for the web, enabling:
	â€¢	Media platforms to fight misinformation.
	â€¢	Universities & employers to verify credentials.
	â€¢	Communities to build decentralized reputation systems.
	â€¢	Enterprises to anchor compliance proofs on-chain.
